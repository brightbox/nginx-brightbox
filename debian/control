Description: small, but very powerful and efficient web server
 Nginx (engine x) is a web server created by Igor Sysoev and kindly provided
 to the open-source community. This server can be used as standalone HTTP
 server and as a reverse proxy server before some Apache or another big 
 server to reduce load to backend servers by many concurrent HTTP-sessions.
