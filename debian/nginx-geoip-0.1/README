Nginx GeoIP module
--

Description:
--

The Nginx GeoIP module is based on the original Geo module, the difference being that
it is not being controlled by a piece of config, but makes use of the MaxMind GeoIP binary
API natively. It provides for fast lookups from both the binary GeoLite and GeoIP Country
databases available from MaxMind.

One of the advantages to use the binary databases and API is getting automated updates
from MaxMind through the geoipupdate utility. This is also the reason why SPIL GAMES wrote
this module.


Installation:
--

You'll need to re-compile Nginx from source to include this module.
Modify your compile of Nginx by adding the following directive
(modified to suit your path of course):

./configure --add-module=/absolute/path/to/nginx-geoip-0.1
make
make install


Usage:
--

Change your Nginx config file to include the 'geoip_country_file' directive:

    geoip_country_file /absolute/path/to/GeoIP.dat;


This will provide the following variables:

    $geoip_country_code, $geoip_country_code3, $geoip_country_name
