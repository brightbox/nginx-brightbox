<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph"><p>Phusion Passenger works on any POSIX-compliant operating system. In other
words: practically any operating system on earth, except Microsoft Windows.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Phusion Passenger is confirmed on a large number of operating systems and Linux
distributions, including, but not limited to, Ubuntu, Debian, CentOS/Fedora/RHEL,
Gentoo, Mac OS X, FreeBSD and Solaris. Both 32-bit and 64-bit platforms are supported.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>The only POSIX-compliant operating system on which Phusion Passenger for Apache is
known not to work at this time, is OpenBSD. Please use Phusion Passenger for Nginx
instead.</p></div>

<div class="sectionbody">
<h3 id="_generic_installation_instructions">2.1. Generic installation instructions</h3>
<h4 id="install_passenger">2.1.1. Overview of installation methods</h4>
<div class="paragraph"><p>There are three ways to install Phusion Passenger:</p></div>
<div class="olist arabic"><ol class="arabic">
<li>
<p>
By installing the Phusion Passenger gem, as instructed on the
   <a href="http://www.modrails.com/install.html">&#8220;Install&#8221; page on the Phusion
   Passenger website</a>.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
By downloading the source tarball from the Phusion Passenger website
   (<em>passenger-x.x.x.tar.gz</em>).
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
By installing a native Linux package (e.g. Debian package).
</p>
</li>
</ol></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>The following sections will explain each installation method. Please read the
section for the installation method that you prefer. In our opinion, installing
the gem or the native package is easiest. For these two installation methods,
Phusion Passenger provides an easy-to-use installer.</p></div>
<h4 id="_preparation_gem_and_source_tarball_only">2.1.2. Preparation (gem and source tarball only)</h4>
<div class="paragraph"><p>If you want to install Phusion Passenger via the gem or the source tarball,
then some preparations might be required. You can skip this subsection if
you&#8217;re installing Phusion Passenger via a native Linux package, because no
compilation is necessary.</p></div>
<h5 id="_switching_to_a_root_command_prompt">Switching to a root command prompt</h5>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Before installing, you will probably need to switch to the <tt>root</tt> user first.
When you install Phusion Passenger via a gem or a source tarball, some Phusion
Passenger files have to be compiled, which requires write access to the
directory in which the Phusion Passenger files are located. On Unix systems,
the root user is the user who has write access to the entire system. So unless
you know that your normal user account has write access to the Phusion Passenger
directory, you should switch to root before installing Phusion Passenger.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>You can switch to root by typing the following command:</p></div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre><tt>sudo -s</tt></pre>
</div></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>This will open a command prompt as the root user, from which you can proceed
with installing Phusion Passenger.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>If your system does not have <em>sudo</em> installed, please type the following command instead, which should do the same thing:</p></div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre><tt>su</tt></pre>
</div></div>
<h5 id="specifying_correct_apache_install">Specifying the correct Apache installation</h5>
<div class="paragraph"><p>The Phusion Passenger installer will attempt to automatically detect Apache,
and compile Phusion Passenger against that Apache version. It does this by
looking for the <tt>apxs</tt> or <tt>apxs2</tt> command in the PATH environment variable.
Apxs is an integral part of any Apache installation.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>However, some systems have multiple Apache installations. This is likely
the case on MacOS X: the OS ships with Apache, but users tend to install
another Apache version seperately, e.g. via MacPorts. If your system has
multiple Apache installations, then you will need to tell the Phusion Passenger
installer which one to use. It is very important that you specify the
correct Apache installation, because if you load Phusion Passenger in an
Apache installation that it wasn&#8217;t compiled against, then it will likely
crash.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>On yet other systems, Apache is installed in a non-standard location,
preventing the Phusion Passenger installer from detecting Apache. This
is most likely the case on systems on which Apache was installed by hand
from source, i.e. as opposed to installed through the system&#8217;s native
package manager. If this is the case, then you will also have to tell
the installer where it can find Apache.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>To do so, set the <tt>APXS2</tt> environment variable to the full path of the
correct <tt>apxs</tt> or <tt>apxs2</tt> command. Suppose that you want to use the Apache
installation in <em>/opt/apache2</em>. Then, assuming that the corresponding
<tt>apxs</tt> program&#8217;s path is <em>/opt/apache2/bin/apxs</em>, type:</p></div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre><tt>export APXS2=/opt/apache2/bin/apxs</tt></pre>
</div></div>
<div class="admonitionblock">
<table><tr>
<td class="icon">
<img src="./images/icons/note.png" alt="Note" />
</td>
<td class="content">On some systems, the <tt>apxs</tt> program might be called <tt>apxs2</tt>, and it might
be located in the <tt>sbin</tt> folder instead of the <tt>bin</tt> folder.</td>
</tr></table>
</div>
<div class="admonitionblock">
<table><tr>
<td class="icon">
<img src="./images/icons/note.png" alt="Note" />
</td>
<td class="content">
<div class="title">Environment variables and <em>sudo</em></div>By default, the <em>sudo</em> command will erase any environment variables that it
doesn&#8217;t recognize, prior to executing the given command. So if you set APXS2 as a
normal user, then run <tt>sudo passenger-install-apache2-module</tt> (which is the command
for the Phusion Passenger installer), then the installer will not receive the
environment variable value that you set. To solve this problem, please become root
prior to setting any environment variables, as described in the previous subsection.</td>
</tr></table>
</div>
<h5 id="specifying_ruby_installation">Specifying the correct Ruby installation</h5>
<div class="paragraph"><p>If your system has multiple Ruby installations&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;which is likely the case on
MacOS X, or if you&#8217;ve also installed
<a href="http://www.rubyenterpriseedition.com">Ruby Enterprise Edition</a>&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;then you
will need to tell the operating system which Ruby installation to use, prior to
running the Phusion Passenger installer. If you only have one Ruby installation
(the case on most Linux systems), then you can skip this section because Phusion
Passenger will automatically detect it.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>To specify a Ruby installation, prepend your Ruby installation&#8217;s <tt>bin</tt>
directory to the <tt>PATH</tt> environment variable. For example, if you have the
following Ruby installations:</p></div>
<div class="ulist"><ul>
<li>
<p>
/usr/bin/ruby
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
/opt/myruby/bin/ruby
</p>
</li>
</ul></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>and you want to use the latter, then type:</p></div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre><tt>export PATH=/opt/myruby/bin:$PATH</tt></pre>
</div></div>
<h4 id="_installing_via_the_gem">2.1.3. Installing via the gem</h4>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Please install the gem and then run the Phusion Passenger installer, by typing the
following commands:</p></div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre><tt>gem install passenger-x.x.x.gem
passenger-install-apache2-module</tt></pre>
</div></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Please follow the instructions given by the installer.</p></div>
<h4 id="_installing_via_the_source_tarball">2.1.4. Installing via the source tarball</h4>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Extract the tarball to whatever location you prefer. <strong>The Phusion Passenger files
are to reside in that location permanently.</strong> For example, if you would like
Phusion Passenger to reside in <tt>/opt/passenger-x.x.x</tt>:</p></div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre><tt>cd /opt
tar xzvf ~/YourDownloadsFolder/passenger-x.x.x.tar.gz</tt></pre>

<h4 id="_installing_via_a_native_linux_package">2.1.5. Installing via a native Linux package</h4>
<div class="paragraph"><p>John Leach from Brightbox has kindly provided an Ubuntu Hardy package for Phusion Passenger. The package is available from the <a href="http://apt.brightbox.net">Brightbox repository</a>.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Please install the native Linux package, e.g.:</p></div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre><tt>sudo sh -c 'echo "deb http://apt.brightbox.net hardy main" &gt; /etc/apt/sources.list.d/brightbox.list'

sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install libapache2-mod-passenger</tt></pre>
</div></div>
<h4 id="_what_does_the_installer_do">2.1.6. What does the installer do?</h4>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Although we call it an &#8220;installer&#8221;, it doesn&#8217;t actually install anything.
The installer checks whether all required dependencies are installed,
compiles Phusion Passenger for you, and tells you how to modify the Apache
configuration file, but it doesn&#8217;t copy any files around.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p><tt>passenger-install-apache2-module</tt> is actually just a user-friendly frontend
around the command <tt>rake apache2</tt>, which performs the actual compilation of
Phusion Passenger.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><div class="title">What does this option do?</div><p>Recall that Phusion Passenger spawns multiple backend processes (e.g. multiple
Ruby on Rails processes), each which processes HTTP requests serially. One of
Phusion Passenger&#8217;s jobs is to forward HTTP requests to a suitable backend
process. A backend process may take an arbitrary amount of time to process a
specific HTTP request. If the websites are (temporarily) under high load, and
the backend processes cannot process the requests fast enough, then some
requests may have to be queued.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>If global queuing is turned off, then Phusion Passenger will use <em>fair load
balancing</em>. This means that each backend process will have its own private
queue. Phusion Passenger will forward an HTTP request to the backend process
that has the least amount of requests in its queue.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>If global queuing is turned on, then Phusion Passenger will use a global queue
that&#8217;s shared between all backend processes. If an HTTP request comes in, and
all the backend processes are still busy, then Phusion Passenger will wait until
at least one backend process is done, and will then forward the request to that
process.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><div class="title">When to turn on global queuing?</div><p>You should turn on global queuing if one of your web applications may have
long-running requests.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>For example suppose that:</p></div>
<div class="ulist"><ul>
<li>
<p>
global queuing is turned off.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
we&#8217;re currently in a state where all backend processes have 3 requests in
  their queue, except for a single backend process, which has 1 request in its
  queue.
</p>
</li>
</ul></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>The situation looks like this:</p></div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre><tt>Backend process A:  [*     ]  (1 request in queue)
Backend process B:  [***   ]  (3 requests in queue)
Backend process C:  [***   ]  (3 requests in queue)
Backend process D:  [***   ]  (3 requests in queue)</tt></pre>
</div></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Each process is currently serving short-running requests.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Phusion Passenger will forward the next request to backend process A. A will
now have 2 items in its queue. We&#8217;ll mark this new request with an X:</p></div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre><tt>Backend process A:  [*X    ]  (2 request in queue)
Backend process B:  [***   ]  (3 requests in queue)
Backend process C:  [***   ]  (3 requests in queue)
Backend process D:  [***   ]  (3 requests in queue)</tt></pre>
</div></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Assuming that B, C and D still aren&#8217;t done with their current request, the next
HTTP request - let&#8217;s call this Y - will be forwarded to backend process A as
well, because it has the least number of items in its queue:</p></div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre><tt>Backend process A:  [*XY   ]  (3 requests in queue)
Backend process B:  [***   ]  (3 requests in queue)
Backend process C:  [***   ]  (3 requests in queue)
Backend process D:  [***   ]  (3 requests in queue)</tt></pre>
</div></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>But if request X happens to be a long-running request that needs 60 seconds to
complete, then we&#8217;ll have a problem. Y won&#8217;t be processed for at least 60
seconds. It would have been a better idea if Y was forward to processes B, C or
D instead, because they only have short-living requests in their queues.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>This problem will be avoided entirely if you turn global queuing on. With global
queuing, all backend processes will share the same queue. The first backend
process that becomes available will take from the queue, and so this
&#8220;queuing-behind-long-running-request&#8221; problem will never occur.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Turning global queuing off will yield a minor performance improvement (about 5%,
depending on how fast/slow your web application is), which is why it&#8217;s off by
default.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>This option is especially useful if Apache is not allowed to write to /tmp

<div class="paragraph"><div class="title">Command line tools</div><p>Some Phusion Passenger command line administration tools, such as
<tt>passenger-status</tt>, must know what Phusion Passenger&#8217;s temp directory is
in order to function properly. You can pass the directory through the
<tt>PASSENGER_TMPDIR</tt> environment variable, or the <tt>TMPDIR</tt> environment variable
(the former will be used if both are specified).</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>For example, if you set <em>PassengerTempDir</em> to <em>/my_temp_dir</em>, then invoke

<h3 id="PassengerUploadBufferDir">5.10. PassengerUploadBufferDir &lt;directory&gt;</h3>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Phusion Passenger buffers large file uploads to disk in order prevent slow file

Phusion Passenger&#8217;s default) then you <strong>must</strong> ensure that this directory exists.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>This configuration directive is also useful if you&#8217;re using apache2-mpm-itk.
The buffered file upload directory that Phusion Passenger creates by default has
very strict permissions: it can only be accessed by the Apache worker processes.
However, Phusion Passenger assumes that all Apache worker processes are running
as the same user. apache2-mpm-itk breaks this assumption by running multiple
Apache worker processes as different users. So if you&#8217;re using apace2-mpm-itk,
you should set this option to a directory that is writable by all Apache worker
processes, such as <em>/tmp</em>.</p></div>

</div></div>
<div class="paragraph"><div class="title">What are the security reasons for wanting to customize PassengerRestartDir?</div><p>Touching restart.txt will cause Phusion Passenger to restart the application.
So anybody who can touch restart.txt can effectively cause a Denial-of-Service
attack by touching restart.txt over and over. If your web server or one of your
web applications has the permission to touch restart.txt, and one of them has a
security flaw which allows an attacker to touch restart.txt, then that will
allow the attacker to cause a Denial-of-Service.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>You can prevent this from happening by pointing PassengerRestartDir to a
directory that&#8217;s readable by Apache, but only writable by administrators.</p></div>

</div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Internally, Phusion Passenger spawns multiple Ruby on Rails processes in order to handle
requests. But there are multiple ways with which processes can be spawned, each having
its own set of pros and cons. Supported spawn methods are:</p></div>
<div class="dlist"><dl>
<dt class="hdlist1">
<em>smart</em>
</dt>
<dd>
<p>
When this spawn method is used, Phusion Passenger will attempt to cache Ruby on Rails
framework code and application code for a limited period of time. Please read
<a href="#spawning_methods_explained">Spawning methods explained</a> for a more detailed
explanation of what smart spawning exactly does.
</p>
<div class="paragraph"><p><strong>Pros:</strong>
This can significantly decrease spawn time (by as much as 90%). And, when Ruby Enterprise
Edition is used, <a href="#reducing_memory_usage">memory usage can be reduced by 33% on average</a>.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p><strong>Cons:</strong>
Some Ruby on Rails applications and libraries are not compatible with smart spawning.
If that&#8217;s the case for your application, then you should use <em>conservative</em> as
spawning method.</p></div>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">
<em>smart-lv2</em>
</dt>
<dd>
<p>
This spawning method is similar to <em>smart</em> but it skips the framework spawner
and uses the application spawner directly. This means the framework code is not
cached between multiple applications, although it is still cached within
instances of the same application. Please read
<a href="#spawning_methods_explained">Spawning methods explained</a> for a more detailed
explanation of what smart-lv2 spawning exactly does.
</p>
<div class="paragraph"><p><strong>Pros:</strong> It is compatible with a larger number of applications when compared to
the <em>smart</em> method, and still performs some caching.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p><strong>Cons:</strong> It is slower than smart spawning if you have many applications which
use the same framework version. It is therefore advised that shared hosts use the
<em>smart</em> method instead.</p></div>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">
<em>conservative</em>
</dt>
<dd>
<p>
This spawning method is similar to the one used in Mongrel Cluster. It does not
perform any code caching at all. Please read
<a href="#spawning_methods_explained">Spawning methods explained</a> for a more detailed
explanation of what conservative spawning exactly does.
</p>
<div class="paragraph"><p><strong>Pros:</strong>
Conservative spawning is guaranteed to be compatible with all Rails applications
and libraries.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p><strong>Cons:</strong>
Much slower than smart spawning. Every spawn action will be equally slow, though no slower than
the startup time of a single server in Mongrel Cluster. Conservative spawning will also
render <a href="#reducing_memory_usage">Ruby Enterprise Edition&#8217;s memory reduction technology</a> useless.</p></div>

<h3 id="debugging_frozen">7.3. Debugging frozen applications</h3>
<div class="paragraph"><p>If one of your application instances is frozen (stopped responding), then you

<div class="paragraph"><p>The exception (with full backtrace information) is normally logged into the Apache
error log. But if your application or if its web framework has its own exception logging
routines, then exceptions might be logged into the application&#8217;s log files instead.
This is the case with Ruby on Rails. So if you kill a Ruby on Rails application with
<em>SIGABRT</em>, please check the application&#8217;s <em>production.log</em> first (assuming that you&#8217;re

<h2 id="_tips">8. Tips</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<h3 id="user_switching">8.1. User switching (security)</h3>
<div class="paragraph"><p>There is a problem that plagues most PHP web hosts, namely the fact that all PHP
applications are run in the same user context as the web server. So for
example, Joe&#8217;s PHP application will be able to read Jane&#8217;s PHP application&#8217;s
passwords. This is obviously undesirable on many servers.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Phusion Passenger solves this problem by implementing <em>user switching</em>. A Rails
application is started as the owner of the file <em>config/environment.rb</em>,
and a Rack application is started as the owner of the file <em>config.ru</em>.
So if <em>/home/webapps/foo/config/environment.rb</em> is owned by <em>joe</em>, then Phusion
Passenger will launch the corresponding Rails application as <em>joe</em> as well.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>This behavior is the default, and you don&#8217;t need to configure anything. But
there are things that you should keep in mind:</p></div>
<div class="ulist"><ul>
<li>
<p>
The owner of <em>environment.rb</em> must have read access to the Rails application&#8217;s
  folder, and read/write access to the Rails application&#8217;s <em>logs</em> folder.
  Likewise, the owner of <em>config.ru</em> must have read access to the Rack application&#8217;s
  folder.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
This feature is only available if Apache is started by <em>root</em>. This is the
  case on most Apache installations.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Under no circumstances will applications be run as <em>root</em>. If
  <em>environment.rb</em>/<em>config.ru</em> is owned as root or by an unknown user, then the
  Rails/Rack application will run as the user specified by
  <a href="#PassengerDefaultUser">PassengerDefaultUser (Apache)</a>/<a href="#PassengerDefaultUser">passenger_default_user (Nginx)</a>.
</p>
</li>
</ul></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>User switching can be disabled with the

<h3 id="sub_uri_deployment_uri_fix">8.7. How to fix broken images/CSS/JavaScript URIs in sub-URI deployments</h3>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Some people experience broken images and other broken static assets when they
deploy their application to a sub-URI (i.e. <em>http://mysite.com/railsapp/</em>).
The reason for this usually is that you used a
static URI for your image in the views. This means your <em>img</em> source probably refers
to something like <em>/images/foo.jpg</em>. The leading slash means that it&#8217;s an absolute URI:
you&#8217;re telling the browser to always load <em>http://mysite.com/images/foo.jpg</em> no
matter what. The problem is that the image is actually at
<em>http://mysite.com/railsapp/images/foo.jpg</em>. There are two ways to fix this.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>The first way (not recommended) is to change your view templates to refer to
<em>images/foo.jpg</em>. This is a relative URI: note the lack of a leading slash). What
this does is making the path relative to the current URI. The problem is that if you
use restful URIs, then your images will probably break again when you add a level to
the URI.
For example, when you&#8217;re at <em>http://mysite.com/railsapp</em> the browser will look for
<em>http://mysite.com/railsapp/images/foo.jpg</em>. But when you&#8217;re at
<em>http://mysite.com/railsapp/controller</em>. the browser will look for
<em>http://mysite.com/railsapp/controller/images/foo.jpg</em>.
So relative URIs usually don&#8217;t work well with layout templates.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>The second and highly recommended way is to always use Rails helper methods to
output tags for static assets. These helper methods automatically take care
of prepending the base URI that you&#8217;ve deployed the application to. For images
there is <tt>image_tag</tt>, for JavaScript there is <tt>javascript_include_tag</tt> and for
CSS there is <tt>stylesheet_link_tag</tt>. In the above example you would simply remove
the <em>&lt;img&gt;</em> HTML tag and replace it with inline Ruby like this:</p></div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre><tt>&lt;%= image_tag("foo.jpg") %&gt;</tt></pre>
</div></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>This will generate the proper image tag to <tt>$RAILS_ROOT/public/images/foo.jpg</tt>
so that your images will always work no matter what sub-URI you&#8217;ve deployed to.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>These helper methods are more valuable than you may think. For example they also
append a timestamp to the URI to better facilitate HTTP caching. For more information,
please refer to
<a href="http://api.rubyonrails.org/classes/ActionView/Helpers/AssetTagHelper.html">the Rails API docs</a>.</p></div>

<h2 id="_under_the_hood">9. Under the hood</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph"><p>Phusion Passenger hides a lot of complexity for the end user (i.e. the web server
system administrator), but sometimes it is desirable to know what is going on.
This section describes a few things that Phusion Passenger does under the hood.</p></div>
<h3 id="_static_assets_serving">9.1. Static assets serving</h3>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Phusion Passenger accelerates serving of static files. This means that, if an URI
maps to a file that exists, then Phusion Passenger will let Apache serve that file
directly, without hitting the web application.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Phusion Passenger does all this without the need for any mod_rewrite rules. People
who are switching from an old Mongrel-based setup might have mod_rewrite rules such
as these:</p></div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre><tt># Check whether this request has a corresponding file; if that
# exists, let Apache serve it, otherwise forward the request to
# Mongrel.
RewriteCond %{DOCUMENT_ROOT}/%{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f
RewriteRule ^(.*)$ balancer://mongrel%{REQUEST_URI} [P,QSA,L]</tt></pre>
</div></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>These kind of mod_rewrite rules are no longer required, and you can safely remove
them.</p></div>
<h3 id="_page_caching_support">9.2. Page caching support</h3>
<div class="paragraph"><p>For each HTTP request, Phusion Passenger will automatically look for a corresponding
page cache file, and serve that if it exists. It does this by appending ".html" to
the filename that the URI normally maps to, and checking whether that file exists.
This check occurs after checking whether the original mapped filename exists (as part
of static asset serving). All this is done without the need for special mod_rewrite
rules.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>For example, suppose that the browser requests <em>/foo/bar</em>.</p></div>
<div class="olist arabic"><ol class="arabic">
<li>
<p>
Phusion Passenger will first check whether this URI maps to a static file, i.e.
   whether the file <em>foo/bar</em> exists in the web application&#8217;s <em>public</em> directory.
   If it does then Phusion Passenger will serve this file through Apache immediately.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
If that doesn&#8217;t exist, then Phusion Passenger will check whether the file
   <em>foo/bar.html</em> exists. If it does then Phusion Passenger will serve this file
   through Apache immediately.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
If <em>foo/bar.html</em> doesn&#8217;t exist either, then Phusion Passenger will forward the
   request to the underlying web application.
</p>
</li>
</ol></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Note that Phusion Passenger&#8217;s page caching support doesn&#8217;t work if your web
application uses a non-standard page cache directory, i.e. if it doesn&#8217;t cache to
the <em>public</em> directory. In that case you&#8217;ll need to use mod_rewrite to serve such
page cache files.</p></div>
<h3 id="application_detection">9.3. How Phusion Passenger detects whether a virtual host is a web application</h3>
<div class="paragraph"><p>After you&#8217;ve read the deployment instructions you might wonder how Phusion Passenger
knows that the DocumentRoot points to a web application that Phusion Passenger is
able to serve, and how it knows what kind of web application it is (e.g. Rails or Rack).</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Phusion Passenger checks whether the virtual host is a Rails application by checking
whether the following file exists:</p></div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre><tt>dirname(DocumentRoot) + "/config/environment.rb"</tt></pre>
</div></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>If you&#8217;re not a programmer and don&#8217;t understand the above pseudo-code snippet, it means
that Phusion Passenger will:</p></div>
<div class="olist arabic"><ol class="arabic">
<li>
<p>
Extract the parent directory filename from the value of the DocumentRoot directory.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Append the text "/config/environment.rb" to the result, and check whether the resulting
   filename exists.
</p>
</li>
</ol></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>So suppose that your document root is <em>/webapps/foo/public</em>. Phusion Passenger will check
whether the file <em>/webapps/foo/config/environment.rb</em> exists.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Note that Phusion Passenger does <strong>not</strong> resolve any symlinks in the document root path by
default since version 2.2.0&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;in contrast to versions earlier than 2.2.0, which do resolve
symlinks.
So for example, suppose that your DocumentRoot points to <em>/home/www/example.com</em>, which in
turn is a symlink to <em>/webapps/example.com/public</em>. In versions earlier than 2.2.0, Phusion
Passenger will check whether <em>/webapps/example.com/config/environment.rb</em> exists because it
resolves all symlinks. Phusion Passenger 2.2.0 and later however will check for
<em>/home/www/config/environment.rb</em>. This file of course doesn&#8217;t exist, and as a result Phusion
Passenger will not activate itself for this virtual host, and you&#8217;ll most likely see an Apache
mod_dirindex directory listing.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>If you need the old symlink-resolving behavior for whatever reason, then you can turn on
<a href="#PassengerResolveSymlinksInDocumentRoot">PassengerResolveSymlinksInDocumentRoot</a>.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Another way to solve this situation is to explicitly tell Phusion Passenger what the
correct application root is through the <a href="#PassengerAppRoot">PassengerAppRoot</a> configuration
directive.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Autodetection of Rack applications happens through the same mechanism, exception that
Phusion Passenger will look for <em>config.ru</em> instead of <em>config/environment.rb</em>.</p></div>

<h2 id="spawning_methods_explained">12. Appendix C: Spawning methods explained</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph"><p>At its core, Phusion Passenger is an HTTP proxy and process manager. It spawns
Ruby on Rails/Rack/WSGI worker processes (which may also be referred to as
<em>backend processes</em>), and forwards incoming HTTP request to one of the worker
processes.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>While this may sound simple, there&#8217;s not just one way to spawn worker processes.
Let&#8217;s go over the different spawning methods. For simplicity&#8217;s sake, let&#8217;s
assume that we&#8217;re only talking about Ruby on Rails applications.</p></div>
<h3 id="_the_most_straightforward_and_traditional_way_conservative_spawning">12.1. The most straightforward and traditional way: conservative spawning</h3>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Phusion Passenger could create a new Ruby process, which will then load the
Rails application along with the entire Rails framework. This process will then
enter an request handling main loop.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>This is the most straightforward way to spawn worker processes. If you&#8217;re
familiar with the Mongrel application server, then this approach is exactly
what mongrel_cluster performs: it creates N worker processes, each which loads
a full copy of the Rails application and the Rails framework in memory. The Thin
application server employs pretty much the same approach.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Note that Phusion Passenger&#8217;s version of conservative spawning differs slightly
from mongrel_cluster. Mongrel_cluster creates entirely new Ruby processes. In
programmers jargon, mongrel_cluster creates new Ruby processes by forking the
current process and exec()-ing a new Ruby interpreter. Phusion Passenger on the
other hand creates processes that reuse the already loaded Ruby interpreter. In
programmers jargon, Phusion Passenger calls fork(), but not exec().</p></div>
<h3 id="_the_smart_spawning_method">12.2. The smart spawning method</h3>
<div class="admonitionblock">
<table><tr>
<td class="icon">
<img src="./images/icons/note.png" alt="Note" />
</td>
<td class="content">Smart spawning is only available for Ruby on Rails applications, not for
      Rack applications or WSGI applications.</td>
</tr></table>
</div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>While conservative spawning works well, it&#8217;s not as efficient as it could be
because each worker process has its own private copy of the Rails application
as well as the Rails framework. This wastes memory as well as startup time.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p><span class="image">
<img src="images/conservative_spawning.png" alt="Worker processes and conservative spawning" title="Worker processes and conservative spawning" />
</span><br />
<em>Figure: Worker processes and conservative spawning. Each worker process has its
own private copy of the application code and Rails framework code.</em></p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>It is possible to make the different worker processes share the memory occupied
by application and Rails framework code, by utilizing so-called
copy-on-write semantics of the virtual memory system on modern operating
systems. As a side effect, the startup time is also reduced. This is technique
is exploited by Phusion Passenger&#8217;s <em>smart</em> and <em>smart-lv2</em> spawn methods.</p></div>
<h4 id="_how_it_works">12.2.1. How it works</h4>
<div class="paragraph"><p>When the <em>smart-lv2</em> spawn method is being used, Phusion Passenger will first
create a so-called <em>ApplicationSpawner server</em> process. This process loads the
entire Rails application along with the Rails framework, by loading
<em>environment.rb</em>. Then, whenever Phusion Passenger needs a new worker process,
it will instruct the ApplicationSpawner server to do so. The ApplicationSpawner
server will create a worker new process
that reuses the already loaded Rails application/framework. Creating a worker
process through an already running ApplicationSpawner server is very fast, about
10 times faster than loading the Rails application/framework from scratch. If
the Ruby interpreter is copy-on-write friendly (that is, if you&#8217;re running
<a href="#reducing_memory_usage">Ruby Enterprise Edition</a>) then all created worker
processes will share as much common
memory as possible. That is, they will all share the same application and Rails
framework code.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p><span class="image">
<img src="images/smart-lv2.png" alt="images/smart-lv2.png" />
</span><br />
<em>Figure: Worker processes and the smart-lv2 spawn method. All worker processes,
as well as the ApplicationSpawner, share the same application code and Rails
framework code.</em></p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>The <em>smart</em> spawn method goes even further, by caching the Rails framework in
another process called the <em>FrameworkSpawner server</em>. This process only loads
the Rails framework, not the application. When a FrameworkSpawner server is
instructed to create a new worker process, it will create a new
ApplicationSpawner to which the instruction will be delegated. All those
ApplicationSpawner servers, as well as all worker processes created by those
ApplicationSpawner servers, will share the same Rails framework code.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>The <em>smart-lv2</em> method allows different worker processes that belong to the same
application to share memory. The <em>smart</em> method allows different worker
processes - that happen to use the same Rails version - to share memory, even if
they don&#8217;t belong to the same application.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Notes:</p></div>
<div class="ulist"><ul>
<li>
<p>
Vendored Rails frameworks cannot be shared by different applications, even if
  both vendored Rails frameworks are the same version. So for efficiency reasons
  we don&#8217;t recommend vendoring Rails.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
ApplicationSpawner and FrameworkSpawner servers have an idle timeout just
  like worker processes. If an ApplicationSpawner/FrameworkSpawner server hasn&#8217;t
  been instructed to do anything for a while, it will be shutdown in order to
  conserve memory. This idle timeout is configurable.
</p>
</li>
</ul></div>
<h4 id="_summary_of_benefits">12.2.2. Summary of benefits</h4>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Suppose that Phusion Passenger needs a new worker process for an application
that uses Rails 2.2.1.</p></div>
<div class="ulist"><ul>
<li>
<p>
If the <em>smart-lv2</em> spawning method is used, and an ApplicationSpawner server
  for this application is already running, then worker process creation time is
  about 10 times faster than conservative spawning. This worker process will also
  share application and Rails framework code memory with the ApplicationSpawner
  server and the worker processes that had been spawned by this ApplicationSpawner
  server.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
If the <em>smart</em> spawning method is used, and a FrameworkSpawner server for
  Rails 2.2.1 is already running, but no ApplicationSpawner server for this
  application is running, then worker process creation time is about 2 times
  faster than conservative spawning. If there is an ApplicationSpawner server
  for this application running, then worker process creation time is about 10
  times faster. This worker process will also share application and Rails
  framework code memory with the ApplicationSpawner and FrameworkSpawner
  servers.
</p>
</li>
</ul></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>You could compare ApplicationSpawner and FrameworkSpawner servers with stem
cells, that have the ability to quickly change into more specific cells (worker
process).</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>In practice, the smart spawning methods could mean a memory saving of about 33%,
assuming that your Ruby interpreter is <a href="#reducing_memory_usage">copy-on-write friendly</a>.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Of course, smart spawning is not without gotchas. But if you understand the
gotchas you can easily reap the benefits of smart spawning.</p></div>
<h3 id="_smart_spawning_gotcha_1_unintential_file_descriptor_sharing">12.3. Smart spawning gotcha #1: unintential file descriptor sharing</h3>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Because worker processes are created by forking from an ApplicationSpawner
server, it will share all file descriptors that are opened by the
ApplicationSpawner server. (This is part of the semantics of the Unix
<em>fork()</em> system call. You might want to Google it if you&#8217;re not familiar with
it.) A file descriptor is a handle which can be an opened file, an opened socket
connection, a pipe, etc. If different worker processes write to such a file
descriptor at the same time, then their write calls will be interleaved, which
may potentially cause problems.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>The problem commonly involves socket connections that are unintentially being
shared. You can fix it by closing and reestablishing the connection when Phusion
Passenger is creating a new worker process. Phusion Passenger provides the API
call <tt>PhusionPassenger.on_event(:starting_worker_process)</tt> to do so. So you
could insert the following code in your <em>environment.rb</em>:</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>Since a <em>fork()</em> makes a (virtual) complete copy of a process, all its file
descriptors will be copied as well. What we see here is that ApplicationSpawner
and Worker process 1 both share the same connection to Memcached.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Now supposed that your site gets Slashdotted and Phusion Passenger needs to
spawn another worker process. It does so by forking ApplicationSpawner. The
result is now as follows:</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>As you can see, Worker process 1 and Worker process 2 have the same Memcache
connection.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Suppose that users Joe and Jane visit your website at the same time. Joe&#8217;s
request is handled by Worker process 1, and Jane&#8217;s request is handled by Worker
process 2. Both worker processes want to fetch something from Memcached. Suppose
that in order to do that, both handlers need to send a "FETCH" command to Memcached.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>But suppose that, after worker process 1 having only sent "FE", a context switch
occurs, and worker process 2 starts sending a "FETCH" command to Memcached as
well. If worker process 2 succeeds in sending only one bye, <em>F</em>, then Memcached
will receive a command which begins with "FEF", a command that it does not
recognize. In other words: the data from both handlers get interleaved. And thus
Memcached is forced to handle this as an error.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>This problem can be solved by reestablishing the connection to Memcached after forking:</p></div>

<h4 id="_example_2_log_file_sharing_not_harmful">12.3.2. Example 2: Log file sharing (not harmful)</h4>
<div class="paragraph"><p>There are also cases in which unintential file descriptor sharing is not harmful.
One such case is log file file descriptor sharing. Even if two processes write
to the log file at the same time, the worst thing that can happen is that the
data in the log file is interleaved.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>To guarantee that the data written to the log file is never interleaved, you
must synchronize write access via an inter-process synchronization mechanism,
such as file locks. Reopening the log file, like you would have done in the
Memcached example, doesn&#8217;t help.</p></div>
<h3 id="_smart_spawning_gotcha_2_the_need_to_revive_threads">12.4. Smart spawning gotcha #2: the need to revive threads</h3>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Another part of the <em>fork()</em> system call&#8217;s semantics is the fact that threads
disappear after a fork call. So if you&#8217;ve created any threads in environment.rb,
then those threads will no longer be running in newly created worker process.
You need to revive them when a new worker process is created. Use the
<tt>:starting_worker_process</tt> event that Phusion Passenger provides, like this:</p></div>

<h3 id="_smart_spawning_gotcha_3_code_load_order">12.5. Smart spawning gotcha #3: code load order</h3>
<div class="paragraph"><p>This gotcha is only applicable to the <em>smart</em> spawn method, not the <em>smart-lv2</em>
spawn method.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>If your application expects the Rails framework to be not loaded during the
beginning of <em>environment.rb</em>, then it can cause problems when an
ApplicationSpawner is created from a FrameworkSpawner, which already has the
Rails framework loaded. The most common case is when applications try to patch
Rails by dropping a modified file that has the same name as Rails&#8217;s own file,
in a path that comes earlier in the Ruby search path.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>For example, suppose that we have an application which has a patched version
of <em>active_record/base.rb</em> located in <em>RAILS_ROOT/lib/patches</em>, and
<em>RAILS_ROOT/lib/patches</em> comes first in the Ruby load path. When conservative
spawning is used, the patched version of <em>base.rb</em> is properly loaded. When
<em>smart</em> (not <em>smart-lv2</em>) spawning is used, the original <em>base.rb</em> is used
because it was already loaded, so a subsequent <tt>require "active_record/base"</tt>
has no effect.</p></div>
