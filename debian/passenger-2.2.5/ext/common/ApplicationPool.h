/**
 * A persistent pool of Applications.
 *
 * Spawning application instances, especially Ruby on Rails ones, is a very expensive operation.
 * Despite best efforts to make the operation less expensive (see SpawnManager),
 * it remains expensive compared to the cost of processing an HTTP request/response.
 * So, in order to solve this, some sort of caching/pooling mechanism will be required.
 * ApplicationPool provides this.
 *
 * Normally, one would use SpawnManager to spawn a new RoR/Rack application instance,
 * then use Application::connect() to create a new session with that application
 * instance, and then use the returned Session object to send the request and
 * to read the HTTP response. ApplicationPool replaces the first step with
 * a call to Application::get(). For example:
 * @code
 *   ApplicationPool pool = some_function_which_creates_an_application_pool();
 *   
 *   // Connect to the application and get the newly opened session.
 *   Application::SessionPtr session(pool->get("/home/webapps/foo"));
 *   
 *   // Send the request headers and request body data.
 *   session->sendHeaders(...);
 *   session->sendBodyBlock(...);
 *   // Done sending data, so we shutdown the writer stream.
 *   session->shutdownWriter();
 *
 *   // Now read the HTTP response.
 *   string responseData = readAllDataFromSocket(session->getStream());
 *   // Done reading data, so we shutdown the reader stream.
 *   session->shutdownReader();
 *
 *   // This session has now finished, so we close the session by resetting
 *   // the smart pointer to NULL (thereby destroying the Session object).
 *   session.reset();
 *
 *   // We can connect to an Application multiple times. Just make sure
 *   // the previous session is closed.
 *   session = app->connect("/home/webapps/bar")
 * @endcode
 *
 * Internally, ApplicationPool::get() will keep spawned applications instances in
 * memory, and reuse them if possible. It wil* @throw l try to keep spawning to a minimum.
 * Furthermore, if an application instance hasn't been used for a while, it
 * will be automatically shutdown in order to save memory. Restart requests are
 * honored: if an application has the file 'restart.txt' in its 'tmp' folder,
 * then get() will shutdown existing instances of that application and spawn
 * a new instance (this is useful when a new version of an application has been
 * deployed). And finally, one can set a hard limit on the maximum number of
 * applications instances that may be spawned (see ApplicationPool::setMax()).
 *
 * Note that ApplicationPool is just an interface (i.e. a pure virtual class).
 * For concrete classes, see StandardApplicationPool and ApplicationPoolServer.
 * The exact pooling algorithm depends on the implementation class.
 *
 * @ingroup Support
