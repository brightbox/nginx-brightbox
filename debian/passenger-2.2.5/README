== Introduction

Phusion Passenger probably requires no introduction. We kindly refer the reader
to http://www.modrails.com/ for general information.

== Installation

=== Regular installation

You can install either Phusion Passenger for Apache or for Nginx. Run either of
the following programs as root:

 ./bin/passenger-install-apache2-module

-OR-

 ./bin/passenger-install-nginx-module

That's it. :)

For troubleshooting, configuration and tips, please read the corresponding
Users Guide:

 doc/Users guide Apache.html
 doc/Users guide Nginx.html

These files are included in the source tarball, and may also be viewed online on
our website.

=== Installing via a gem

You may also first generate a .gem file, and then install that.
First, make sure that you have the following software installed:
- Doxygen: http://www.stack.nl/~dimitri/doxygen/
- Asciidoc: http://www.methods.co.nz/asciidoc/

Next, run:

 rake package

The gem will be available under the 'pkg' folder.
