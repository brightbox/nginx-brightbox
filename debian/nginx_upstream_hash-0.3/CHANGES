Changes with upstream_hash 0.3                                   06 Aug 2008

    *) Bugfix: infinite loop when retrying after a 404 and the "not_found"
       flag of *_next_upstream was set.

    *) Change: no more "hash_method" directive. Hash method is always CRC-32.

    *) Change: failover strategy is compatible with PECL Memcache
