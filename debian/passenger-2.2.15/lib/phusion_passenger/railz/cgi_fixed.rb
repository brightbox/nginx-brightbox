# Modifies CGI so that we can use it.  Main thing it does is expose
# the stdinput and stdoutput so RequestHandler can connect them to
# the right sources.  It also exposes the env_table so that RequestHandler
# can hook the request parameters into the environment table.
#
# This is partially based on the FastCGI code, but much of the Ruby 1.6 
# backwards compatibility is removed.
