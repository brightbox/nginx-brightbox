<banner>Deploying a Ruby on Rails application: an example</banner>

Suppose you have a Rails application in <b>/somewhere</b>. Add a virtual host to your
Apache configuration file and set its DocumentRoot to <b>/somewhere/public</b>:
<b>
   <VirtualHost *:80>
      ServerName www.yourhost.com
      DocumentRoot /somewhere/public    # <-- be sure to point to 'public'!
      <Directory /somewhere/public>
         AllowOverride all              # <-- relax Apache security settings
         Options -MultiViews            # <-- MultiViews must be turned off
      </Directory>
   </VirtualHost>
</b>
And that's it! You may also want to check the Users Guide for security and
