 * We used to use an apr_bucket_pipe for forwarding the backend process's
 * response to the HTTP client. However, apr_bucket_pipe has a number of
 * issues:
 * - It closes the pipe's file descriptor when it has reached
 *   end-of-stream, but not when an error has occurred. This behavior is
 *   undesirable because it can easily cause file descriptor leaks.
 * - It does weird non-blocking-I/O related things which can cause it
 *   to read less data than can actually be read.
 *
 * PassengerBucket is like apr_bucket_pipe, but:
 * - It also holds a reference to a Session. When a read error has occured
 *   or when end-of-stream has been reached, the Session will be
 *   dereferenced, so that the underlying file descriptor is closed.
 * - It ignores the APR_NONBLOCK_READ flag because that's known to cause
 *   strange I/O problems.
 * - It can store its current state in a PassengerBucketState data structure.
