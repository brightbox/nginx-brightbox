<red>Permission problems</red>

This installer must be able to write to the following directory:

  <b><%= @path || ::PASSENGER_ROOT %></b>

But it can't do that, despite the fact that it's running as root. There's
probably a permission problem. Please fix the permissions for the
aforementioned directory, and re-run this installer.
